1. What is "conditional rendering"?

when you only render something if a condition is met

2. When would you use &&?

when you want to not render anything if the condition is not met

3. When would you use a ternary?

when you want to render something but it you would want to render different things depending on the conditions

4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?

you can combine nest ternaries, you can combine ternaries and &&, or you can just call a function that returns a string and the content of that string is determined by
the conditions
