1. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples?

a side effect is something that happens when you use React in conjunction with something that goes outside of React's necessary domain. An example is fetching from an API.

2. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples?

something that is not a side effect in React is something that happens when you use React, and only things that are necessarily in React's domain, like a simple isolated 
state.

3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?
   
React runs the useEffect function when the component renders and the dependency array is changed from its last recorded state. The useEffect function does not run if the 
dependency array has not changed from its last recorded state.  

4. How would you explain what the "dependecies array" is?

The dependencies array is a state that is specifically used to notice its changes and allow the useEffect function to run.
